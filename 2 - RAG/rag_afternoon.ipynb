    "### ***1/ Understanding chunking***\n",
    "\n",
    "In Parts II and III, we worked with short, single-sentence documents. That made things easy.  \n",
    "But in real applications, your knowledge base is made of **long documents** : PDFs, reports, articles, internal docs...\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't just embed an entire 10-page document as a single vector. Why ?\n",
    "- Embeddings work best on **short texts** (a few sentences). A single embedding for a whole document would lose the details.\n",
    "- When you retrieve a long document, most of it is **irrelevant** to the question. You'd waste the LLM's context window.\n",
    "- LLMs have **context limits** - you can't feed them an entire book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is **chunking** : splitting long documents into smaller, meaningful pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How chunking works :**\n",
    "- We define a **maximum chunk size** (e.g. 500 characters).\n",
    "- We walk through the text and cut at approximately every 500 characters.\n",
    "- But we don't cut in the middle of a sentence ! We look for the **last sentence boundary** (period, exclamation mark...) before the limit, so each chunk contains **complete sentences**.\n",
    "- We also add an **overlap** between chunks (e.g. 100 characters). This means the end of one chunk is repeated at the start of the next one. This prevents losing context at the boundaries - if an important fact spans two chunks, the overlap ensures it appears fully in at least one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with chunk_size=500, overlap=100 :**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Document: \"Sentence A. Sentence B. Sentence C. Sentence D. Sentence E. ...\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `documents/` folder, you will find **5 text files** about TechCorp.  \n",
